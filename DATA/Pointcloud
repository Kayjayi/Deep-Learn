Using Numba for Parallel Processing on CPU
Numba is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. It can significantly speed up computation by leveraging parallel processing.

Using cuPy for GPU Acceleration
cuPy is a library that implements NumPy-compatible multi-dimensional array on CUDA. It allows you to perform array operations on GPU, which can significantly speed up computations for large datasets.

import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

def downsample_point_cloud_cupy(points, voxel_size):
    points_gpu = cp.asarray(points)
    grid_indices = cp.floor(points_gpu / voxel_size).astype(cp.int32)

    downsampled_points = cp.zeros((len(unique_indices), points.shape[1]))

    for i in range(len(unique_indices)):
        indices = cp.all(grid_indices == unique_indices[i], axis=1)
        downsampled_points[i] = points_gpu[indices].mean(axis=0)

    return downsampled_points.get()

# Load point cloud

# Downsample point cloud using GPU

Using Open3D with Multi-threading
Open3D provides a voxel downsampling function that is optimized and can be further accelerated using multi-threading. However, it's primarily CPU-based.


import open3d as o3d
import numpy as np

# Load point cloud
point_cloud = np.load("path/to/large_point_cloud.npy")

# Create Open3D point cloud
pcd = o3d.geometry.PointCloud()
pcd.points = o3d.utility.Vector3dVector(point_cloud[:, :3])

# Downsample using voxel grid
voxel_size = 0.05  # Adjust voxel size as needed
downsampled_pcd = pcd.voxel_down_sample(voxel_size)

# Convert back to numpy array
downsampled_point_cloud = np.asarray(downsampled_pcd.points)

# Save downsampled point cloud
np.save("downsampled_point_cloud.npy", downsampled_point_cloud)
